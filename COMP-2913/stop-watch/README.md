# Stop Watch Example

An example solution for a stop-watch application

## Instructions

- Create a new React application, name it “stop-watch”.

- Create a component called “StopWatch”.

- Your Stop Watch should render a timer that starts automatically when the View loads.

- The timer should be in the format “mm:ss”. Eg. 01:15 (1 minute and 15 seconds). Do not worry about times over 1 hour.

- The timer should update the view every second.

- Display a button labeled “Pause”. This button pauses the timer.

- When paused, button should display “Start”. Clicking on it restarts the timer.

- Display a button labeled “Reset”. This button resets the timer to 0 and stops the timer.

- When the timer is 0, the “Pause” button should be re-labeled as “Start”.

- When the timer is 0 and the timer is not running, the Reset button should be disabled. Ensure that the button is also visibly disabled.

- Make sure to test it, to avoid bugs. What happens if the Start button is clicked multiple times? How about if the Stop button is clicked multiple times?
